## Playground (development)

```sh
$ yarn global add parcel-bundler
$ yarn
$ lerna bootstrap
$ yarn play
```

This should run the package `playground` in the browser for you, with live-reload enabled, which is basically a sandbox for fooling around and to freely test any other package from `packages`.
