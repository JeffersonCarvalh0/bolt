# Pismo Bolt
Styleguide and React components

## Playground (development)

```sh
> yarn global add parcel-bundler
> yarn
> lerna bootstrap
> yarn play
```

## Documentation

We're using [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen) to extract all the information from the components source codes, and then generating friendly markdown from it.

To update the docs files simply run:

```sh
> yarn doc
```

Check the `/docs` folder for the updated `.json` and `.md` files (soon).
